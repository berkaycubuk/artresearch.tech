## Electronics

We have the capability to design, assemble and test Printed Circuit Boards “PCBs” from prototype to small series production. Then using our in-house CNC and Laser Cutter we can rapidly create custom enclosures for a professional finish.
Using custom PCB's removes excessive wiring, miniturises the footprint and decreases production time and ensures the reliability of the final system.

## 3D Design and Fabrication

To speed up lead-times and bring the cost down A.R.T uses the latest software combined with digital fabrication machinery that are focused on rapid prototyping and cost effective production.

We create minimal and functional designs which start from a wide knowledge of materials and hardware and always take into account installation, maintenance and replacement. 

Our Axiom Pro AR4 CNC Router can cut Aluminium, acrylic, polycarbonate and acetal while the 50W Laser can etch and cut acrylic, plywood and Aluminium. Finally our 3D printers create rapid prototypes in ABS, PLA and composite plastics.

We also partner with selected subcontractors to outsource elements outside our scope of services allowing us to focus on project specific assembly lines for batch processing large quantities of parts.  

## Motion and Mechanisms

Creating motion and mechanisms bespoke to each individual application has led us to create our own control systems which are silent, smooth and reliable. 
Using our own A.R.T motor controllers, motions can be pre-programmed providing better precision control of speed and position.
Mechanisms can be rapidly prototyped in-house using the laser cutter and 3D printers with the final production version machined from Aluminium for durability. We stock a large selection of power supplies, motors and mechanical parts to speed up the prototyping process.

## Liquids and Fog

Often fluid tanks are hidden or built into the installation making it hard to keep track of the amount of liquid used. Our remote monitoring system uses sensors to feedback the fluid level to a website or an external display removing the involvement of a trained technician.  
Using a range of fluid pumps the flow of soap, water or smoke fluid can be controlled quietly and safely around installations or within artworks.
A.R.T has designed and produced custom scent nebulisers that can disperse scent in open spaces or mix scent with stage fog. The nebuliser has evolved from multiple projects where scent has been needed to be dispensed in a controlled environment.
We have a range of products and fittings developed for moving fog around sculptures based on years of experience.

## Control and Monitoring

A.R.T has created its own product line of controllers and software for a wide variety of installations and artwork each built to suit individual application and the level of complexity. 
We specialise in turn key installations which automate startup and shut down processes, monitor power and safety systems while orchestrating sequences and animations to bring the project to life.
Using sensor data collected from within the installation our controllers can connect to the internet and provide live system status for remote diagnosis which can be accessed online around the world. This has proven to save costs and time during installation and maintenance.

## Interactive Media

Engage your audience with A.R.T’s unique combination of our own installation controllers and digital signage media players. Use a range of buttons, touch screens or movement sensors to trigger HD or 4K video and audio content.

We work closely with content creators to mesh our own animatronics, special effects and lighting with high quality digital media content displayed on projectors and monitors.

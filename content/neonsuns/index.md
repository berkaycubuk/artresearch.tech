Standing 8m high and weighing 20 tonnes, an immersive installation that pays homage to the cyanobacteria, one of the world's smallest living beings. The sculpture is a monument to their vital creation, which continues to provide the oxygen in every breath we take.

*Brief*. Design, build and install a control cabinet to manage fluid distribution, power startup / shut down at set times each day and sequence the firing of the smoke ring cannons.

*Electrical Design*. This permanent installation was designed for a 10 year service life. The control cabinet was designed to provide easy access to the electrical system for testing and diagnosis by a technician.

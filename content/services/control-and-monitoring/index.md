We have the capability to design, assemble and test Printed Circuit Boards “PCBs” from prototype to small series production. Then using our in-house CNC and Laser Cutter we can rapidly create custom enclosures for a professional finish.
Using custom PCB's removes excessive wiring, miniturises the footprint and decreases production time and ensures the reliability of the final system.

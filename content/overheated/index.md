Overheated transformed a third-floor gallery in Hong Kong into an abandoned, underground boiler room. Steam periodically hissed out from between the joints as visitors are invited to navigate around the room and interact with the industrial pipework.

*Brief*. Design and build a silent, fog smoke machine, integrate a timer to trigger periodically and vent the smoke out around the joint of an industrial pipe.

*Smoke generator*. An entirely new design of silent and programmable smoke machine was created to be installed inside the industrial pipe work of the sculpture. A medical grade pump was used for its precision and low noise. Onboard a temperature sensor and controller kept the heater at a constant 250 degrees Celsius.

*Heatproof*. The heating element and temperature sensor is wrapped in 20mm of bespoke ceramic insulation, inside is 250 degrees and outside is warm to the touch.

*Venting*. A custom designed 4 layer aluminum sandwich was CNC cut to release the smoke between two huge industrial pipe fittings into the gallery.

headlineText: "Standing 8m high and weighing 20 tonnes, an immersive installation that pays homage to the cyanobacteria, one of the worldâ€™s smallest living beings. The sculpture is a monument to their vital creation, which continues to provide the oxygen in every breath we take."

rightText: "A programmable timer triggers the startup procedure in the morning as the venue opens to the public. It makes sure all the fog machine heaters are warm enough to operate before the trigger signal is sent. This provides a consistent uninterrupted display for the public. The timer then shuts the sculpture down at closing time."

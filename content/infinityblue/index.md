Standing 8m high and weighing 20 tonnes, an immersive installation that pays homage to the cyanobacteria, one of the world's smallest living beings. The sculpture is a monument to their vital creation, which continues to provide the oxygen in every breath we take.

*Brief*. Design, build and install a control cabinet to manage fluid distribution, power startup / shut down at set times each day and sequence the firing of the smoke ring cannons.

*Keeping time*. A programmable timer triggers the startup procedure in the morning as the venue opens to the public. It makes sure all the fog machine heaters are warm enough to operate before the trigger signal is sent. This provides a consistent uninterrupted display for the public. The timer then shuts the sculpture down at closing time.

*Fluid motion*. The levels of the fluid tanks are measured constantly so the control logic can operate pump circuitry to top up the internal tanks. The logic is designed to top up the tank as infrequently as possible to keep the noise to a minimum.

*Electrical Design*. This permanent installation was designed for a 10 year service life. The control cabinet was designed to provide easy access to the electrical system for testing and diagnosis by a technician.

*Sense of smell*. The control cabinet also timed the release of scents into the cannons allowing layers of distinct aromas to fill the installation.

*Programming*. A microcontroller was custom made and programmed to fire 32 cannons in a choreographed sequence lasting 1 hour. This hourly animation is repeated in a loop. An LCD screen and buttons were added to provide a user interface to test each cannon individually

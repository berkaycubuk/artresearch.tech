A unique experience featuring a huge stream of fog-filled bubbles cascading down from an 8 meters. The artwork represents the flow of billions of bubbles creating the roaring white water of a natural waterfall.

*Brief*. Design, fabricate and install 25 units of fog filled bubble machines, to be sequenced, controlled and fault diagnosed over the internet. Design and fabricate the fluid distribution and pumping system, and safety measures.

*A New Invention*. Working alongside chemical engineers, programmers and fabricators a new type of fully adjustable fog filled bubble machine was born. To make a bubble filled with fog is a delicate balance of key ingredients, any change in temperature, humidity, soap ratio, and water conductivity could cause it to fail so each component had to be adjustable remotely. From the electronics and power supply to the fog tank and bubble nozzle it was all 3D designed and fabricated on a laser cutter and 3D printer.

*Pumping station*. The fluid control system constantly measured tank levels and pumped soap and water from the two 1000 litre tanks in the base to the two smaller 25 litre tanks standing 8.5m above the ground. This provided the 25 bubble machines with a constant uninterrupted supply of soap and water.

*Remote Control*. Using a combination of different coloured status LEDs mounted on each unit seen by the webcam and remote access we could diagnose faults and keep the exhibition running in Saudi Arabia from the base in London. All 25 units can be updated and controlled over Wifi and from any country. This cost considerably less than a trained technician staying with the exhibition for the length of time its operating.
